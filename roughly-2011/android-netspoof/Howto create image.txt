Firstly, create a disk image with these commands:
The count is how large the file should be in kb. At least 650MB is needed.

dd if=/dev/zero of=debian.img bs=1024 count=900000
mke2fs -F debian.img

Next, mount the newly created image to a folder:

mkdir deb-mnt
sudo mount -o loop debian.img deb-mnt/

This command actually downloads the base debian system to this image:

sudo debootstrap --arch armel --foreign squeeze deb-mnt/ http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian

Finally, unmount it.

sudo umount deb-mnt

Next, copy the specified files AND this new image to your SD card (keeping the file names)
and run the setup script in a terminal emulator on the phone OR use adb to do it from the
computer.
