				<h2>Info & Tutorial</h2>
				<p>The asset which you will trade is a bottle of pennies. Although there is only one reference bottle, you may buy and sell many other bottles each based on the value of the original. The true value of this reference asset will be made known at the end of the game.</p>
				
				<h3>Checking your current wealth</h3>
				<p>Initially everyone has a cash holding and a holding of 100 bottles. As the game evolves, check your cash balance and current number of bottles on the left side of the screen ('My Current Wealth'). Every time you buy from someone else, your account is debited with an amount of cash that depends on a quote, and your bottle holdings increased by the amount you purchased. Every time you sell to someone else the reverse happens, your cash goes up and number of bottles held goes down.</p>
				<p>By entering a price at which you think you could sell all your remaining bottles, you can estimate your total wealth shown in the 'Est. total' column, e.g. if you thought that you could sell all 100 bottles for 1p then your total wealth would be your cash balance plus Â£1.</p>
				<p>At the end of the game when the exact price of the bottle is known, this procedure will be used to determine who has the most cash and is therefore the winner.</p>

				<h3>Posting buy quotes and sell quotes</h3>
				<p>You can't force others to trade with you, you must offer to buy or sell and have some accept, or accept an existing quote.</p>
				<p>To quote, on the right of the screen, enter the number of bottles to sell or buy, and the pennies per each bottle, ie you should enter a prospective trade amount (e.g. 1 bottle), and trade price (e.g. 1 pence per bottle). Any of your own quotes can be withdrawn manually at any time by clicking on your quote in the left hand 'My Open Quotes' table (see below). Once posted, if your quote is one of the best 30 available (lowest 15 sell quotes and highest 15 buy quotes) it will automatically appear on the center 'Quotes' page (see below). This does not guarantee a sale or purchase, this will only occur if another party accepts one of your quotes. You may post multiple quotes but the programme will only show competitive quotes.</p>
				
				<h3>Accepting someone else's quote</h3>
				<p>On the Quotes table (centre), if you see a quote that you want to accept, simply click on that quote. It is up to you to decide which of competing quotes to accept, if any, although if you believe the price will rise you should try and buy bottles and if you think it will fall you should try and sell. If you click on a quote, you will be asked in a dialogue box to confirm that you really want to do what the quote describes (clicking on a sell quote means you wish to purchase from the named counterparty and clicking on a buy quote means you wish to sell to them).</p>
				<p>Once you have accepted the trade, it cannot be cancelled and you will be able to confirm that your cash and bottle details have been updated on the left. Once a quote has been accepted it will automatically disappear from the current quotes table allowing another competing quote onto the screen. The quote provider can of course replace the quote with another should he or she wish to continue with their strategy.</p>

				<h3>Cash and short sale constraints</h3>
				<p>You will be prevented from buying if you do not have sufficient cash to complete the purchase chosen. You will also be prevented from selling if you do not have sufficient bottles left in your potential inventory.</p>

				<h3>Information</h3>
				<p>At several points in the game, more information will be revealed about the reference penny bottle. Trading is permitted at any time when the market is not suspended and trading is not permitted elsewhere.</p>
				<h3>Potential and Final Wealth</h3>
				<p>You may update your estimate of the reference bottle value in order to see an estimate of your wealth. (My Current Wealth)</p>
				<p>You can also see your wealth if all of your current quotes were accepted, on the first line of the 'My Potential Wealth' table; this is calculated from your current wealth and your current quotes. You can also see the potential wealth if all sell quotes were accepted, and if all buy quotes were accepted.</p>
				<p>At the end of the game the administrator will delete all open quotes and set the final value of the bottle at the true value. This will determine the winner.</p>
