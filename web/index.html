				<h2>Info & Tutorial</h2>
				<p>The asset which you will trade is a bottle of pennies that will appear in one of the class sessions. Although there is only one bottle, you may buy and sell many bottles each based on the value of this one bottle. The true value of this asset will be made known at the end of the game.</p>
				
				<h3>Checking your current wealth</h3>
				<p>Initially everyone has a cash holding of around £400 and an asset holding of around 100 bottles. As the game evolves, check your cash balance and current number of bottles on the left side of the screen ('My Current Worth'). Every time you buy from someone else, your account is debited with the appropriate amount of cash and your bottle holdings increased by the amount you purchased. Every time you sell to someone else the reverse happens, your cash goes up and number of bottles held goes down. By entering a price at which you think could sell all your remaining bottles, you can estimate your total wealth shown in the 'Est. total' column, e.g. if you could sell all 100 bottles for 100p your total wealth would be your cash balance plus 10,000p (£100.00). At the end of the game when the exact price of a bottle is known, this procedure will be used to determine who has the most cash and is therefore the winner. There may be a small prize for the winner but it will not reflect the amount of virtual money you have collected (all monetary amounts are strictly virtual)!</p>
				<p>
					You can also see your wealth if all of your current quotes were accepted, on the first line of the 'My Predicted Worth' table; this is calculated from your current worth and your current quotes. You can also see the potential worth if all sell quotes were accepted, and if all buy quotes were accepted.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Posting buy quotes and sell quotes</h3>
				<p>From the right of the screen, enter the number of bottles to sell or buy, and the pennies per each bottle. You should enter a prospective trade amount (e.g. 1 bottle), and trade price (e.g. 100 pence per bottle). Any of your own quotes can be withdrawn manually at any time by clicking on your quote in the left hand 'My Open Quotes' table (see below). Once posted, if your quote is one of the best 30 available (lowest 15 sell quotes and highest 15 buy quotes) it will automatically appear on the center 'quotes' page (see below). This does not guarantee a sale or purchase, this will only occur if another party accepts one of your quotes. You may post multiple quotes but the programme may show your best one or two or even none of them if other quotes are more competitive.</p>
				
				<h3>Accepting someone else's quote</h3>
				<p>On the current quotes table (centre), if you see a quote that you want to accept, simply click on that quote. It is up to you to decide which of competing quotes to accept, if any, although if you believe the price will rise you should try and buy bottles and if you think it will fall you should try and sell. If you click on a quote, you will be asked in a dialogue box to confirm that you really want to do what the quote described (clicking on a sell quote means you wish to purchase from the named counterparty and clicking on a buy quote means you wish to sell to them). Once you have accepted the trade, it cannot be cancelled and you will be able to confirm that your cash and bottle details have been updated on your own details page. Once a quote has been accepted it will automatically disappear from the current quotes table allowing another competing quote onto the screen. The offeror can of course replace the quote with another should he or she wish to continue with their strategy.</p>

				<h3>Cash and short sale constraints</h3>
				<p>You will be prevented from buying if you do not have sufficient cash to complete the purchase chosen. You will also be prevented from selling if you do not have sufficient bottles left in your inventory.</p>

				<h3>Information</h3>
				<p>At several points in the course, more information will be revealed about the penny bottle. Trading in the game permitted at any time of day although trading is not permitted outside these penny market web pages since only trades completed here will be cleared through the accounts. You may post any items of interest on the webboard but it is the responsibility of each individual to verify the authenticity of all information.</p>
				<p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
