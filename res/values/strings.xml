<string name="AboutText1">Bright Day periodically changes the brightness of your phone\'s screen throughout the day, making it more visible in the middle of the day, and less bright at night.</string>
<string name="AboutText2">It runs in the background, and will automatically run when your phone starts.\n\nKnown bugs:\n* Brightness is not immediately updated upon bootup (nothing can be done about this, just turn the screen off and on after the phone has booted, and the correct brightness will appear.)</string>
